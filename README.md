# React-Meetup-Planner

A react app which you can find some meetups and new friends.
In this app you can add meetups to your favorite list or you can set them to your schedule.
You can also create and add your own meetup.

This app was just a training for my react courses to cover some of react features such as react hooks, react context and ... .

#### `npm start` runs the app in the development mode.
